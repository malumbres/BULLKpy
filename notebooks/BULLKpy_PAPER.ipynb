    "For TCGA, the most reproducible primary grouping is the TCGA project code (e.g., LUAD, LUSC, BRCA…). This is stable and unambiguous.\n",

    "\t•\tClassic SCLC is not a TCGA tumor type cohort in the same way as LUAD/LUSC. If you truly want NSCLC vs SCLC, you’ll likely need an external SCLC cohort (e.g., a published SCLC RNA-seq dataset) as a second repository (which you already said you might include).\n",

    "To evaluate whether neuroendocrine (NE) programs interact with transcriptional heterogeneity to impact patient outcome, we fitted a Cox proportional hazards model including NE score (high vs low), metaprogram heterogeneity (high vs low), and their interaction, while stratifying by tumor type (TCGA Project_ID) to allow for tumor-specific baseline hazards. Both NE score and heterogeneity were associated with adverse outcome, and importantly, the interaction term was significant, indicating that the prognostic impact of NE programs is amplified in tumors with high transcriptional heterogeneity."
